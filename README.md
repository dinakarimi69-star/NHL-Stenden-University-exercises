Debugging Exercise 1 – GAN & Utility Functions (Replit Version)
Overview

This project demonstrates a combination of Python utility functions and a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) trained on the MNIST dataset. It is fully Replit-ready, allowing easy online execution without any setup.
Features:

Utility functions:

Convert numeric fruit IDs to names (id_to_fruit)

Swap x/y coordinates in bounding boxes (swap)

Plot Precision-Recall curves from CSV files (plot_data)

GAN:

Generator and Discriminator implemented in PyTorch

Trains on MNIST digits

Displays generated digits after each epoch for visual inspection
